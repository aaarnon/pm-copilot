# Stakeholder

Coordinates stakeholders and facilitates buy-in. Focuses on cross-functional alignment, communication, and ensuring teams work toward shared outcomes.

---

## Quick Start

1. Identify who needs to be aligned (RACI: Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)
2. Adapt message to audience and phase (Blue/Discovery vs Red/Execution)
3. Choose format: meeting, async doc, or presentation
4. Read framework details from `knowledge/alignment/`

---

## Core Purpose

**Stakeholder answers:**
- How do we get stakeholders aligned?
- How do we communicate progress and decisions?
- Who needs to be involved (RACI)?
- Are teams working toward the same outcomes?

**Stakeholder is NOT:**
- Strategy definition (see `strategy` skill)
- Initiative planning (see `roadmap` skill)
- Product coherence (handled by context files)

---

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Stakeholder Alignment** - Get buy-in from cross-functional stakeholders
2. **Communication Facilitation** - Adapt messaging to audience and phase
3. **RACI Clarity** - Define who's responsible, accountable, consulted, informed
4. **Quarterly Cadence** - Support strategy review meetings

## Key References

For framework details, read from `knowledge/alignment/`:
- **Product Operating Model** → Outcome focus, continuous discovery, cross-functional collaboration
- **Product Alignment Document** → 4-section initiative template
- **Red/Blue communication** → Phase-appropriate messaging
- **OS Discovery Playbook** → Understanding org cycles, rituals, artifacts, decision patterns

**Core concepts:**
- RACI: Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed
- Blue phase = patience, trust | Red phase = progress, predictability

## Output Format

**Primary artifact:** Alignment recommendation

```
## Stakeholders to Align
[Who needs to be involved/informed]

## Key Messages by Audience
- [Audience 1]: [Key message]
- [Audience 2]: [Key message]

## Alignment Approach
[Meeting, async doc, presentation?]

## Decision Required
[What needs to be decided/approved]

## Follow-up Plan
[How to maintain alignment]
```

**Supporting artifacts:**
- Product Alignment Document (initiative one-pager)
- Stakeholder RACI matrix
- Communication plan

## Success Criteria

1. Stakeholders understand the "why" behind initiatives
2. Cross-functional teams working toward same outcomes
3. Decisions made efficiently (not blocked by misalignment)
4. Progress communicated appropriately by phase
5. Quarterly cadence maintained

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-communication** - Not every update needs everyone
2. **Under-communication** - Stakeholders surprised by changes
3. **Wrong message for audience** - Adapt to what they care about
4. **Skipping RACI** - Unclear who decides vs who inputs
5. **One-time alignment** - Alignment needs maintenance
