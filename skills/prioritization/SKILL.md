# Prioritization

Applies structured prioritization frameworks when priorities aren't obvious.

---

## Quick Start

1. Check `context/strategy.md` exists (prioritization needs strategic context)
2. First test: Is priority already obvious? If not, you may have a strategy problem
3. Apply DHM (Delight, Hard-to-copy, Margin-enhancing) or VEUC (Value, Effort, Urgency, Confidence)
4. Match work type to company stage (Pre-PMF → feature work, Scaling → growth work)
5. If still unclear → see `strategy` skill

## Knowledge Access

See `## prioritization` in `resources.md`. Read Core first, Additional as needed.

## Core Principle

> "If priority isn't obvious, you have a strategy problem."

Most prioritization frameworks (RICE, MoSCoW, Kano) are useless because **when it's difficult to decide, the options are basically the same.**

Results are distributed **logarithmically** - some things give 100x impact, one item often delivers more than everything else combined.

## Core Concepts

- If not obvious, you have a strategy problem
- DHM: Delight, Hard-to-copy, Margin-enhancing
- Match work type to stage: Pre-PMF → feature work, Scaling → growth work

## Output Format

```
## Priority Recommendation
[What to prioritize and why]

## Framework Applied
[Which framework, why it fits]

## Trade-offs
[What we're NOT doing and why that's okay]

## Confidence
[How confident, what would change this]
```

## When to Escalate

If prioritization remains unclear after applying frameworks:
→ **Strategy problem** - see `strategy` skill
