# Metrics

Defines and organizes success measurement. Focuses on connecting metrics to outcomes, building impact models, and selecting appropriate success indicators.

---

## Quick Start

1. Check `context/vision.md` and `context/strategy.md` exist (metrics need strategic context)
2. Start with the outcome you want to achieve
3. Identify leading indicators that predict that outcome
4. Choose metrics that are actionable (team can influence)
5. Read framework details from `knowledge/metrics/`

---

## Core Purpose

**Metrics answers:**
- How do we know if we're succeeding?
- What should we measure?
- How do leading indicators connect to business outcomes?
- Should we use OKRs (and when)?

**Metrics is NOT:**
- Data analysis execution (this is strategic metric design)
- Dashboard building (focuses on what to measure, not how)
- Quarterly planning

---

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Impact Model Design** - Build driver trees connecting activities to outcomes
2. **Metric Selection** - Choose right success metrics for initiatives
3. **Leading/Lagging Mapping** - Connect leading indicators to lagging outcomes
4. **OKR Guidance** - Help formulate OKRs (when appropriate)

## Key References

For framework details, read from `knowledge/metrics/`:
- **OKRs** → `okrs-product-management-herbig.md`, `escape-okr-theatre-ant-murphy.md`
- **Impact Models** → `impact-model-roadmap-ed-biden.md`
- **Leading Indicators** → `leading-product-metrics-hustle-badger.md`
- **Success Metrics** → `choosing-success-metrics-hustle-badger.md`
- **Retention/Revenue** → `revenue-retention-metrics-hustle-badger.md`

**Core concepts:**
- Leading indicators = predictive, actionable (activation rate, feature adoption)
- Lagging indicators = outcomes, delayed (revenue, churn)
- Goal: Find leading indicators that predict lagging outcomes

## Output Format

**Primary artifact:** Metric framework for initiative

```
## Success Metric
[Primary metric that indicates success]

## Leading Indicators
- [Indicator 1] - [Relationship to success metric]
- [Indicator 2] - [Relationship to success metric]

## Lagging Outcomes
- [Business outcome this ladders up to]

## Measurement Plan
- [How will we track these?]
- [What's our baseline?]
- [What's our target?]
```

## Success Criteria

1. Metrics connected to business outcomes
2. Leading indicators identified and actionable
3. Appropriate framework for company stage (OKRs optional)
4. Clear measurement plan
5. Metrics are outcomes, not outputs

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Output metrics** - Measuring what we shipped vs impact
2. **Vanity metrics** - Looks good but doesn't matter
3. **Too many metrics** - Focus on 1-3 that matter most
4. **Forcing OKRs** - Not every stage needs quarterly OKRs
5. **Missing leading indicators** - Only tracking lagging outcomes
