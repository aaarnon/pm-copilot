# Initiative Alignment Doc

Creates Product Alignment Documents for initiatives with problem, solution, launch, and impact sections.

---

## Quick Start

1. Start with Problem Definition: objective, success metric, team, risks
2. Add Solution Definition during design phase
3. Complete Launch Readiness before shipping
4. Track Release Impact post-launch

---

## Knowledge Access

See `## initiative-alignment-doc` in `resources.md`. Read Core first, Additional as needed.

---

## When to Use

- Documenting a new initiative for alignment
- Creating "bet artifacts" for roadmap items
- Preparing for stakeholder review
- Recording decisions and rationale

---

## Four Risks Assessment

| Risk | Question | Mitigation Approach |
|------|----------|---------------------|
