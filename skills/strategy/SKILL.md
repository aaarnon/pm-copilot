# Strategy

Defines how to win in the market. Works through three interconnected patterns: why this opportunity (Narrative), where we compete (Playing Field), and how we position to win (Winning Moves).

---

## Quick Start

1. Check `context/vision.md` exists (if not, build foundation first)
2. Identify which pattern needs work: Narrative, Playing Field, or Winning Moves
3. Apply the "Does this help us say NO?" test
4. For detailed frameworks, see `knowledge/strategy/`

---

## Core Purpose

**Strategy answers:**
- How will we win?
- What choices will we make (and NOT make)?
- Where will we focus?
- What advantages will we build?

**Strategy is NOT:**
- Vision (see `vision` skill)
- Roadmap (see `roadmap` skill)
- Execution plan

---

## Quick Reference

```
STRATEGIC NARRATIVE  →  Why this market opportunity?
PLAYING FIELD        →  Where do we compete?
WINNING MOVES        →  How do we position to win?

TEST: Does this help us say NO?
```

See `knowledge/strategy/product-strategy-patterns-herbig.md` for detailed framework with connections.

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Strategic Choices** - Define where to play, how to win, what to prioritize
2. **Framework Application** - Apply DHM, Four Fits, and other strategic frameworks
3. **Strategy Validation** - Test if strategy is decisive, differentiated, feasible
4. **Trade-off Articulation** - Make explicit what we're NOT doing

---

## Key Frameworks

For framework details, read from `knowledge/strategy/`:
- **DHM Framework** → `product-strategy-gibson-biddle.md`
- **Four Fits** → `four-fits-growth-framework-balfour.md`
- **Four Types of Product Work** → `four-types-product-work-reforge.md`
- **Positioning** → `product-positioning-april-dunford.md`
- **Decisive Strategy** → `decisive-strategy-say-no.md`

## Output Format

**Primary artifact:** Strategy document structured by patterns

```
## Strategic Narrative (Why)
**Vision:** [Future state for users]
**North Star:** [1-3 metrics that define winning]
**Goals:** [Mid-to-long-term objectives]

## Playing Field (Where)
**Audiences:** [Who we're building for]
**Jobs:** [Progress they care about]
**Alternatives:** [What we're compared against]

## Winning Moves (How)
**Segments:** [Which customers get priority]
**Value Props:** [What value we deliver]
**Channels:** [How we reach them]
**Differentiators:** [What makes us hard-to-copy]
**Trade-offs:** [What we're NOT doing]

## Validation
Does this strategy help us say NO? [Yes/No + evidence]
```

---

## Success Criteria

1. **Decisive** - Strategy helps team say NO clearly
2. **Differentiated** - Strategy is distinct from alternatives
3. **Actionable** - Teams can derive decisions from it
4. **Aligned** - All three patterns reinforce each other
5. **Focused** - Clear choices, not a list of everything

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Indecisive strategy** - Trying to do everything, no clear focus
2. **Me-too strategy** - Copying competitors without differentiation
3. **Feature list strategy** - Confusing tactics with strategy
4. **Vague platitudes** - "Be customer-focused" without specifics
5. **Mismatched work type** - Growth work when need PMF work
