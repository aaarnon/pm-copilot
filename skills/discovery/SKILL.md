description: Use when discussing problem validation, user research, opportunity mapping, assumptions testing, or "is this worth building."

# Discovery

Validates problems and maps opportunities before committing to solutions. Focuses on understanding user needs, validating assumptions, and building the opportunity backlog.

---

## Quick Start

1. Frame the opportunity as a capability (what users can achieve), not a feature
2. Assess four risks: Value, Usability, Feasibility, Business Viability
3. Determine confidence level needed for decision
4. Recommend: Backlog, Parking Lot, or Bin

---

## Core Purpose

**Discovery answers:**
- What problems are worth solving?
- How do we know this is the right problem?
- What opportunities exist?
- How confident are we in our assumptions?

**Discovery is NOT:**
- Solution definition (that comes after validation)
- Roadmap planning (see `roadmap` skill)
- Execution planning

---

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Problem Validation** - Validate that problems are real and worth solving
2. **Opportunity Mapping** - Create and prioritize opportunity trees
3. **Risk Assessment** - Evaluate Value, Usability, Feasibility, Business Viability risks
4. **Confidence Building** - Gather evidence through research and validation
5. **Interview Synthesis** - Transform customer conversations into actionable insights

## Output Format

**Primary artifact:** Validated opportunity

```
## Opportunity Statement
[Capability framing - what users will be able to achieve]

## Problem Evidence
[Research, data, feedback supporting this]

## Risk Assessment
- Value: [Low/Medium/High] - [Evidence]
- Usability: [Low/Medium/High] - [Evidence]
- Feasibility: [Low/Medium/High] - [Evidence]
- Business Viability: [Low/Medium/High] - [Evidence]

## Confidence Level
[Low/Medium/High] - [Justification]

## Recommendation
[Backlog / Parking Lot / Bin]
```

## Success Criteria

1. Problems validated with evidence (not assumptions)
2. Opportunities framed as capabilities (not features)
3. Risks explicitly assessed
4. Appropriate confidence level for decision
5. Clear recommendation (build, defer, or kill)

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Solution-first thinking** - Start with problem, not solution
2. **Over-researching** - Know when enough evidence is enough
3. **Feature framing** - Frame as capabilities, not features
4. **Skipping risk assessment** - Always assess all four risks
5. **Assumption validation theater** - Seek disconfirming evidence too
