# Vision

Defines the long-term purpose and direction of the product or business. Focuses on the "why" and aspirational future state (3-5+ year horizon).

---

## Quick Start

1. Answer: Why does this product/business exist?
2. Paint the 3-5 year aspirational future state
3. Test: Is it inspiring, clear, differentiating, and stable?
4. See `## Vision` in `resources.md` for knowledge (Core first, Additional as needed)
5. Save to `context/vision.md` (foundation for strategy)

---

## Core Purpose

**Vision answers:**
- Why does this product/business exist?
- What is the purpose we're serving?
- Where do we want to be in 3-5 years if everything goes right?
- What impact do we want to have?

**Vision is NOT:**
- Strategy (see `strategy` skill)
- Roadmap (see `roadmap` skill)
- Short-term goals (quarterly/annual)

---

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Define Purpose** - Articulate why the product/business exists
2. **Aspirational Future State** - Paint picture of success 3-5+ years out
3. **Vision Validation** - Test if vision is inspiring, clear, and differentiated
4. **Vision Communication** - Craft compelling narrative for stakeholders

---

## Core Concepts

- Validation tests: Inspiring, Clear, Differentiating, Actionable, Stable
- Vision = destination (3-5+ years), Strategy = path to get there

---

## Output Format

**Primary artifact:** Vision statement (1-2 paragraphs)

**Supporting artifacts:**
- Vision narrative (extended storytelling version)
- Vision rationale (evidence, market context)

---

## Success Criteria

1. Vision is inspiring and motivating
2. Vision provides clear direction
3. Vision is differentiated from competitors
4. Strategy can derive from vision
5. Vision is stable (not changing quarterly)

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Too tactical** - Vision should not be a feature list
2. **Too vague** - "Change the world" without specificity
3. **Too short-term** - Vision should be 3-5+ years, not 1 year
4. **Conflated with strategy** - Vision is destination, strategy is path
5. **Not inspiring** - Dry corporate-speak that doesn't motivate
