# Roadmap

Plans and communicates product initiatives. Focuses on initiative sequencing, storytelling, and creating artifacts that align teams and stakeholders.

---

## Quick Start

1. Check `context/strategy.md` exists (roadmap derives from strategy)
2. Choose narrative mode based on audience
3. Use Now-Next-Later format with appropriate confidence levels
4. Read framework details from `knowledge/roadmap/`

---

## Core Purpose

**Roadmap answers:**
- What are we building and when?
- Why are we building this (in this order)?
- How does this connect to our strategy?
- What story does this roadmap tell?

**Roadmap is NOT:**
- Strategy definition (see `strategy` skill)
- Problem validation (see `discovery` skill)
- Stakeholder coordination (see `stakeholder` skill)

---

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Initiative Planning** - Sequence initiatives based on strategy and validation
2. **Roadmap Storytelling** - Choose narrative mode for audience
3. **One-Pager Creation** - Document initiatives using Product Alignment Document
4. **Trade-off Communication** - Explain what's in vs out and why

---

## Key Frameworks

For framework details, read from `knowledge/roadmap/`:
- **Narrative modes** → 6 modes for different audiences
- **Now-Next-Later** → Confidence-based time horizons
- **Vision Stack** → How roadmap connects to strategy

**Core concepts:**
- Now = high confidence, committed | Next = medium, planned | Later = low, directional
- Choose narrative mode for audience (Vision-Driven, KPI-Driven, Executive Pitch, etc.)
- Blue phase = outcome-focused | Red phase = delivery-focused

---

## Output Format

**Primary artifact:** Roadmap view (Now-Next-Later)

```
## NOW (Current Quarter)
[Initiative 1] - [Narrative framing]
[Initiative 2] - [Narrative framing]

## NEXT (Following Quarter)
[Initiative 3] - [Narrative framing]

## LATER (Future)
[Initiative 4] - [Narrative framing]
```

**Supporting artifacts:**
- Initiative one-pagers (Product Alignment Document)
- Roadmap narrative (chosen storytelling mode)

---

## Success Criteria

1. Roadmap tells a coherent story
2. Initiatives ladder up to strategy
3. Trade-offs are explicit and explained
4. Appropriate detail level per time horizon
5. Stakeholders understand the "why"

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Feature list masquerading as roadmap** - Include narrative, not just items
2. **Over-committing dates** - Use Now-Next-Later, protect flexibility
3. **Missing strategy connection** - Every initiative should ladder up
4. **Single narrative mode** - Adapt storytelling to audience
5. **Skipping one-pagers** - Document initiatives for alignment
