## How to Access

**`resources.md` is the single source of truth.** Always start here when looking for knowledge.

### When a skill is active:
1. Open `resources.md`
2. Go to the `## [Skill]` section (e.g., `## Strategy`)
3. Read `### Core` resources first (essential for that skill)
4. Read `### Additional` resources as needed for comprehensive coverage

### Structure
```
## Skill
### Core        ← Read these first (essential)
### Additional  ← Read as needed (supplementary)
```

### When no skill matches:
Browse `resources.md` by skill sections. Or scroll to `# Article Reference` tables at the bottom for full browsing by topic.

### Why heading-based organization
- Single lookup location per skill (no filtering needed)
- Clear Core vs Additional hierarchy
- LLMs parse headings better than table columns

## When Sources Conflict

Different experts have different philosophies. This is intentional.

**Use context to select:**

| Context | Lean Toward |
|---------|-------------|
| Pre-PMF, small team | Simpler frameworks, less process |
| Post-PMF, scaling | More structure, cross-team alignment |
| High uncertainty | Discovery-heavy approaches |
| High conviction | Execution-focused approaches |

**If context doesn't resolve it:**
- Present both options with attribution
- Recommend one based on available context
- Let user decide

---

## Do Not

- Pretend there's only one right answer
- Ignore context when recommending
- Apply heavy process to early-stage companies
- Apply startup chaos to scaling companies
- Invent frameworks not in the knowledge base
