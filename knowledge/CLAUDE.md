## How to Access

**When a skill is active:** Go directly to the relevant folder. Skills already reference specific files in their "Key Frameworks" sections. The folder structure mirrors skill domains (strategy/, metrics/, discovery/, etc.).

**When no skill matches:** Start with `resources.md` to browse available frameworks. Filter "Used By" column to find relevant content.

**For cross-domain content:** Handled by skill relationships, not folder structure. Utility skills are mapped to multiple parent skills in `skills/CLAUDE.md`.

## When Sources Conflict

Different experts have different philosophies. This is intentional.

**Use context to select:**

| Context | Lean Toward |
|---------|-------------|
| Pre-PMF, small team | Simpler frameworks, less process |
| Post-PMF, scaling | More structure, cross-team alignment |
| High uncertainty | Discovery-heavy approaches |
| High conviction | Execution-focused approaches |

**If context doesn't resolve it:**
- Present both options with attribution
- Recommend one based on available context
- Let user decide

## Do Not

- Pretend there's only one right answer
- Ignore context when recommending
- Apply heavy process to early-stage companies
- Apply startup chaos to scaling companies
- Invent frameworks not in the knowledge base
